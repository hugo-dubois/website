As I have to do a semester in a foreign country to validate my 4th year in my school in France, I choose Latvia to make it, especially the Riga Technical University.
My first choice was South Korea but because of the Covid-19, the semester was canceled and no many destination left. But I am really happy having be able to travel in a new country to me.
Even if the semester was for me 100% remotely, I enjoyed most of courses I applied.
I have been able to try sport section of RTU, especially volleyball and basketball. Which were pretty hard because coaches only speak some words in english and I cannot understand latvian at all.
