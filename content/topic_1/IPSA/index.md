I am at the moment studying at IPSA, in my 4th year.
The three first years were in Toulouse, a city in the south of France.
But now the last two years take place in Paris.
This is a aerospacial engineering school. I choose this school because since I am a child, I am fascinated by sky and space.
So I want my future work to be in those field. My choice is not fixed yet but for now, I specialized myself in embedded systems.
