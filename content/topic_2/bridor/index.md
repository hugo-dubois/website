To avoid being bored during holidays. I decided to work in industry. I chose the first one that accepted me.
Bridor is a tremendous compagny that is well-known for their croissants and other pastries and dishes they make.
My job was retieve pastry on grids, and then store it into carts that I drove in cold cellar.
I was a bit redundant but after the first weeks, I was able to do more and more things so my post was evolving.
In Bridor I met some new people like Antoine, that is the same age as me. He is now a friend of mine.
