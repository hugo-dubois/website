In order to validate my second year in IPSA, I had to work in industry and make a report about what I learned about this experience.
Even if I was very new to the wide world of work, I rather fastly made my mark in this compagny. People were very kind and taught me very well basement of their work.
Even if it is a small compagny (under 50 workers), it works for international customers, and many others in France. I found it kind of crazy until I realize how hard everybody work there to be a leader in my region.
